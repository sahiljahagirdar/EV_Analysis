Title: Electric Vehicle Analysis

Project Overview:

Introduction:
- This analysis examines the sales of electric vehicles in America, highlighting company-wise performance and market trends.

  
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

1.Total Vehicles:
- Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

2. Average Electric Range:
- Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological
advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

3.Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
- Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
- Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into
the dominance of fully electric models.

4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
-  Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
-  Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into
the market share of plug-in hybrid models.
